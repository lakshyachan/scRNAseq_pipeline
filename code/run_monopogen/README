These outputs can be used to go on and compute correlation with known GT or for eQTL analysis.
Run scripts in the following order:
1. cram2bam.sh to convert all cram files to bam files using the appropriate reference genome assembly.
2. edit_fasta.sh to edit the reference genome assembly file to have 'chr' prefixes as Monopogen is designed to handle only this.
3. monopogen_germline.sh with appropriate reference genome assembly and external reference panel to run PreProcess and Germline functions of Monopogen.
4. Outputs would include .gl, .gp and .phased vcf.gz files containing genotype likelihoods, posteriors and phased hard GT calls respectively.
